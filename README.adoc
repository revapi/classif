A library to sift through java classes using a structural search.

Why would anyone want something like this? Because there are policies on how the code should be organized, what is safe
to use and how, etc. Classif is the first stepping stone for tools that can check such policies. There are tools that
can do similar things with the source code but Classif works on the bytecode level.

Classif is not usable on its own. It can sift through the Java code elements that are thrown at it but it cannot find
them on its own. To use Classif, you need something that will scan the "classpath" (whatever that might mean in your
case) and inform Classif about what you found. Classif can then run its queries on top of your findings. See
<<Developer Guide>> below for more thorough explanation on how to do that.

== Examples

Each of these is actually implemented as a test
link:classif-dsl/src/test/java/org/revapi/classif/readme/ExamplesTest.java[here].

. Match anything annotated by annotation `Anno` with attribute `a` equal to `'x'`:
+
```
@a.Anno(a = 'x') ^;
```

. Match anything that is annotated by annotation `Anno` with attribute `a` not equal to `'x':
+
```
@a.Anno(a != 'x') ^;
```

. Match anything that is not annotated by `Anno`:
+
```
!@a.Anno ^;
```

. Match any type in the package `pkg` (as in Java, type declaration needs to contain the `{}` pair):
+
```
type ^pkg.* {}
```

. Match any class (i.e. not an interface, enum or annotation type) that not in the package `pkg` (notice the use of
negation and regex):
+
```
class ^!/p[kK]g/.* {}
```

. Match any interface in package `pkg` or any subpackage of it:
+
```
interface ^pkg.** {}
```

. Match any type whose name ends in `Private` and which is part of any package:
+
```
type ^**./.*Private/ {}
```

. Match anything that (indirectly) uses a class annotated as `@Unstable`:
+
```
^ uses %c; @Unstable class %c=* {}
```

. Match any type that is annotated `@Unstable` and is used by something annotated `@Stable`:
+
```
match %e; @Unstable type %e=* {} @Stable * uses %e;
```
+
or
+
```
@Unstable type ^ usedby %c {} @Stable %c=*;
```
(the latter only works if supported by the underlying structure provider, while the former should always work)

. Match anything that uses some direct implementation of an interface `Iface`:
+
```
^ uses %impl; type %impl=* directly implements Iface;
```

. Match anything that uses some type that is either itself annotated `@Beta` or extends or implements a type
annotated as `@Beta`:
+
```
^ uses %beta | %extendsBeta | %implementsBeta;
@Example11.Beta type %beta=* {}
@Example11.Beta type %betaForExtends=* {}
@Example11.Beta type %betaForImplements=* {}
type %extendsBeta=* extends %betaForExtends {}
type %implementsBeta=* implements %betaForImplements {}
```

. Match a method called `m` with any number of parameters that is declared in a class that extends a class declared in the
package `x.y` that extends `java.io.InputStream`. Additionally the class with the method `m` implements an interface
that declares a method `k` with any number of parameters. The method `m` is annotated with an annotation that has
an attribute called `attr` with default value of 3:
+
```
class * extends %b implements %i {
  @%a
  ^m(**);
}

class %b=x.y.* extends java.io.InputStream;

interface %i=* {
  k(**);
}

@interface %a=* {
    int attr() default 3;
}
```

== User Guide

Classif matches Java elements with certain structure. You define the needed structure using a "query" that strongly
resembles the actual Java declarations.

Quite often you will want to express dependencies between different declarations and for that you can use variables
within the query.

So without further ado, let dive in and learn to write the queries.

=== Basics

==== What to return

In a simple query, you specify what you want to be the result of the query by using the `^` in front of the name of the
element. E.g. query

```
class ^java.lang.Object {}
```

will return the `java.lang.Object` class.

In case you want to match more things (like for example a class and some method), you might want to use a different way
of declaring what to match by the query.

```
match %class | %method;

class %class=java.lang.Object {}

type * {
  %method=/_.*/(**);
}
```

Whoa, that's a bit of a mouthful. But what can be seen there is that you can declare variables that match certain
elements in the query (in the example above the `%class` and `%method` are variables "assigned" to the matching
elements) and use them in the `match` statement (which needs to be the first statement in the query).

Btw. the above example will match the `java.lang.Object` class and any method with name beginning with and underscore
that has any number of parameters and is present in any type (regardless of whether it is a class, interface, enum,
etc).

==== What's not specified is not matched

This is the general principle. You can match different elements by visibility, annotation presence, contents, usage,
etc.

For example:

```
public class * {}
```

will match all public classes (but not interfaces, enums or annotation types), while

```
class * {}
```

will match the classes regardless of their visibility - all private, package private, protected and public classes will
be matched.

=== Matching Types

==== Matching by modifiers

If you want to constrain the matched types by their visibility, you can do so by using one of the `public`, `protected`,
`private` or Classif's own `packageprivate` qualifiers. The `packageprivate` modifier is required to distinguish
between "any visibility", which in Classif is expressed by the lack of any visibility modifier, and "package private
visibility" which is what Java assumes when there is on other visibility modifier.

There are also other modifiers supported on the types: `static`, `final`, `abstract` and `strictfp`, each as understood
by your favorite Java compiler..

Some examples:

```
public final type **./.*Impl/ {}
```

matches all final types in any package whose names end with "Impl".

```
packageprivate enum * {}
```

matches all package private enums.

[TIP]
--
As mentioned above, to return anything from a query, you need to use the `^` operator in front of the name of
the returned element or the `match` statement mentioning the named elements. So to *return* all the package private
enums, you'd write:

```
packageprivate enum ^* {}
```

--

In addition to specifying single modifiers, you can also "or" multiple together like so:

```
public|protected final static class * {}
```

will match all public or protected static final classes.

Finally, you can also negate the modifiers:

```
!public static !final class * {}
```

matches all classes that are static, not final and not public.

```
!public|static type * {}
```

matches all types that are either not public or static.

==== Matching by annotations

You can match not only by annotation presence on an element, but also by basic checks on the attribute values.

Specifying an annotation again resembles the declarations in the Java source code.

NOTE: Classif doesn't assume anything about the annotation retention. If the calling code is able to supply also
annotations with the source retention, they will be considered. If on the other hand the calling code obtains the
declarations from the compiled bytecode, the annotation with the source retention wil not be available and therefore
not considered.

Basic example:

```
@javax.persistence.Entity
public class * {}
```

will return all public classes annotated as JPA entities.

To find something that is not annotated by some annotation you can write:

```
!@javax.persistence.Entity
@com.acme.MyAnno
type * {}
```

which will find all types that are not annotated by the `javax.persistence.Entity` annotation but are annotated by the
`com.acme.MyAnno` annotation.

To match by annotation attributes, you can write something like this:

```
@javax.persistence.Entity(name != "")
class * {}
```

which will match all JPA entities with an explicitly assigned name (this stems from the fact that the `name` attribute
of the `Entity` annotation happens to have an empty string as its default value).

Notice that you can use more than just assignment when matching the attribute values. The allowed operators are:
`=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<` or `+<=+`. Obviously the less/greater operators only make sense on the numeric attribute values.

When it comes to specifying the value of an attribute to match, there is again a couple of options. You can either
specify the value as in the source code, e.g.

```
@MyAnnotation(stringAttribute = "val", intAttribute > 3, typeAttribute != java.lang.Object.class, enumAttribute = MyEnum.VALUE, arrayAttribute = {1, 2}, annotationAttribute = @MyOtherAnnotation(attribute = 42)) class * {}
```

or you can try using regular expressions for matching strings:

```
@javax.persistence.Entity(name != /.*Private/) class * {}
```

which will match all JPA entity classes with an explicit name attribute which doesn't end with "Private".

additionally, you can specify that you don't actually care about the value using `*`.

Finally, you can check whether an annotation attribute has a value different from its default value like so:

```
@javax.persistence.Entity(name != default) class * {}
```

This will match all JPA entity classes with an explicit name. Note that this is essentially the same as our first
example above with the only difference being that you don't have to know the default value.

The annotation attributes also support globbing. I.e. you can put a wildcard in place of a single or many attributes.

```
@com.acme.Acme(*) type * {}
```

will match any type annotated with the `@com.acme.Acme` annotation with a single attribute specified.

```
@com.acme.Acme(**) type * {}
```

will match any annotated with the `@com.acme.Acme` annotation with zero or more attributes of any name with any value.

Values can be replaced by a `*`, too, meaning, somewhat obviously, "any value". If you happen to match an array value,
like for example:

```
@java.lang.annotation.Target(value = {java.lang.annotation.ElementType.TYPE, **}) @interface * {}
```

you can use globbing of the values as well, as you probably have guessed from the provided example. The example will
match any annotation type that is itself annotated with the `@java.lang.annotation.Target` annotation with the value
attribute having the `TYPE` as the first element in its values, followed by zero or more other element types. Requiring
the `TYPE` to be the first in the array is somewhat restrictive, so you could update it to read
`{**, java.lang.annotation.ElementType.TYPE, **}` which would make the query match with `TYPE` on any position in the
array.

==== Matching by names

In the above examples we were mostly using `+*+` in place of a type name. That is one of the special symbols supported by
Classif. A single `+*+` stands for "any type in any package". Sometimes though we need to be more specific. That's why
Classif also supports full featured globbing of the fully qualified type names.

The single `+*+` is a special case put in place for convenience. In a normal case the fully qualified type names are
globbed similarly to Ant path expressions.

* `+*+` stands for single part of the hierarchical name
* `+**+` stands for any number of parts (0 to many) of the hierarchical name
* a sequence of characters stands for the single part of the hierarchical name with the same name
* the parts of the hierarchical name are separated by `.`
* instead of a sequence of characters, one can also use a regex enclosed in a pair of `/`.

Ok, that's a little bit dense so let's explore it on a couple of examples. Let's suppose we want to match the type with
the fully qualified name `com.acme.util.StringUtils`. Here is a couple of ways how to do it using the above described
globbing features:

`com.acme.util.StringUtils`::
The simplest thing to do is to simply write down all parts of the hierarchical fully qualified name in full.

`+com.*.util.*+`::
In here we're matching the `acme` and `StringUtils` parts of the name using a `+*+`. This expression would of course
match any other class in any package with 3 hierarchical name parts first of which would be `com` and the third one
`util` with the middle being anything. This expression would not match `com.util.Clazz` though because it has too few
parts of the name as well as it would not match `com.acme.util.internal.Misc` because that has too many parts of the
fully qualified name.

`+**.StringUtils+`::
This expression will match a class called `StringUtils` located in any package no matter how deep the hierarchy of the
package name. Contrast that to `+*.StringUtils+` which would only match the class `StringUtils` in packages with a single
part (i.e. the package name without any dots in them). Also notice that the `+**+` doesn't match just the packages. It
merely matches parts of the hierarchical name, so if the class `StringUtils` was an inner class of another class (of any
name, in this concrete example) it would be matched also.

`+com.**.StringUtils+`::
Similar to the above example but showing that you can put the `+**+` wildcard in any place of the hierarchical name.

`+**./.*Utils/+`::
In this example we're using a regular expression `+.*Utils+` to match the class name and the `+**+` wildcard to match
a package of any depth.
+
NOTE: The regular expression always matches only a single part of the hierarchical name.

The whole name can further be negated:

```
type !java.lang.** {}
```

would return all types that are not from the java.lang package or any of its sub-packages.

==== Matching by type parameters

Types can of course be parameterized. To match types by their type parameters, Classif has you covered, of course.

NOTE: Classif conflates wildcards and type variables into a single concept referred to simply as `?`. This is because with
Classif it is not possible to reference the type variables in the later declarations. This may change in the future.

Let's go through some examples of why conflating the wildcards and type variables is kinda ok for a tool like Classif
and also to explain how to use the matching by type parameters.

```
type * extends java.util.Collection<java.io.Serializable> {}
```

This simple example will match any type with any name that extends `Collection<Serializable>`. The type may or may not
be parameterized itself (we don't declare any requirements on the type variables so they're not considered in
the match).

The above declaration will match types like:

```java
// imports ommitted
public interface SerializableCol extends Collection<Serializable> {
  //...
}
```

but will NOT match:

```java
public interface StringCol extends Collection<String> {
  // ...
}
```

That's because we're matching for a concrete type parameter and we're not checking any of its qualities. So for Classif,
`Collection<Serializable>` is just different from `Collection<String>` (as is for Java compiler, too, actually).

Another example:

```
type *<? extends java.io.Serializable> {}
```

This will match any type with a single type parameter that extends `Serializable` (notice that we don't specify any
"name" of the type pamareter, we just use `?`).

This will match types declared like this for example:

```java
public class Serializator<T extends java.io.Serializable> {
  // ...
}
```

But it will NOT match a type declared like this (however such declaration is silly):

```java
public class StringSerializator<T extends java.lang.String> extends Serializator<T> {
  // ...
}
```

because the type variable bounds do not match (even though `String` implements `Serializable`). To match both
`Serializator` and `StringSerializator` (and any other type like them), you'd need to write:

```
type ^*<? extends %s|%es> {}

type %s=java.io.Serializable {}
type %es=* extends java.io.Serializable {}
```

Now if you for example wanted to match all types with a single type parameter no matter their type or anything, you can
use Classif globbing:

```
type ^* extends java.util.Collection<*> {}
```

This will match any type that extends `Collection` and it doesn't matter if the type parameter of the collection is a
concrete type or a type variable.

You can also use globbing for saying "I don't care about type parameters":

```
type ^*<**, ? extends *[], **> {}
```

This says, "find me all types that for some silly reasons require their type parameters to be arrays (of any type)".
The `**` before and after are saying that any other type parameters (if any at all) may precede or succeed
the array-requiring type parameter.


==== Matching by contents

Often you will want to match a type by its "contents". I.e. what fields and methods are declared in it. Taking
inspiration from the regular Java syntax, Classif can express such requirements like this:

```
public type **./.*Util/ {
  public <init>(**) {}
}
```

This would match any class ending in "Util" in any package that happens to have a public constructor with any number
of arguments (0 or more). This is usually considered a code smell because utility classes usually only contain static
helper methods and therefore should not usually be instantiated.

NOTE: As explained further down, Classif uses `<init>` to refer to a constructor so that it can match it without having
to know the name of the enclosing class.

==== Matching by usage

If the type structure provider connected to Classif supports it (by default, Classif doesn't provide any), the queries
can also match types by their usage in other classes/methods/fields declarations (not in the code of the methods).

For example, to find all types used in declarations of another type, you could write:

```
type ^* directly usedby %field | %method {}

class MyClass {
  %field=*;
  %method=*(**);
}

```

If you haven't specified the `directly` before `usedby` the search for usages would be recursive.

A more useful example of this could be:

```
match %type | %method | %field;

@Stable type %type=* uses %unstable {}

@Stable type * {
  public %method=*(**) uses %unstable;
}

@Stable type * {
  public %field=* uses %unstable;
}

@Unstable public|protected type * {}
```

If we had `@Stable` and `@Unstable` annotations that would mark types in the codebase as stable or unstable parts of
the API, the above would match all the types, fields or methods from the stable API that use some unstable API. Note
that because we haven't declared `directly uses` but merely `uses`, the search is performed recursively.

NOTE: It is not prescribed what is exactly meant by "use". It is up to the type structure provider supplied to
Classif to establish that.

==== Matching Hierarchy

You now may wonder what exactly is matched by `type *;`. Only top level types or also inner classes? The answer is
that it depends :) By default this would match all types, top-level and inner. If on the other hand you want to really
only match top-level types, you need to tell Classif about it like so:

```
#strictHierarchy;

type * {}
```

The `#strictHierarchy` is a "pragma" that tells Classif to consider the hierarchy precisely. `type * {}` will only ever
match top-level types, because it itself is a top-level declaration.

This takes into account the structure of the types, of course. If you for example wanted to find all types that have
some inner type, you could write:

```
type ^ {
  type * {}
}
```

Without the `#strictHierarchy` pragma, this would match all types that have an inner class, regardless of whether they
themselves are top-level or inner. With the pragma, it would only return top-level types with an inner class.

=== Matching Methods

We've already seen some example of the fact that Classif can work with methods. In this chapter we will go into the
details of what is possible and how.

In the normal Java code, methods are always enclosed in some class. This is of course reflected in Classif quries.

```
interface * {
  default ^*(**);
}
```

would return all default methods of any interface (public or private).

Let's try to decipher that. First we declare what type should the method be in (it should be an interface type with any
name and any visibility (because we don't require any visibility)). Then we declare the method in that type - it should
be a `default` method with any name (`+*+`) and any number of arguments (glob `+**+`). The `^` tells the query to return
the method as the result of the query.

If our query looked like this:

```
interface ^* {
  default *(**);
}
```

we'd be looking for all interface types that have at least one default method.

==== Matching by annotations

Similarly to types, methods, too, can be queried by the declared annotations.

NOTE: Classif currently doesn't support type-use annotations introduced in Java 8.

If you wanted to convert all method-based JPA definitions to field-based definitions, because your project policy
dictates so, you could find all the violators like this:

```
type * {
  @javax.persistence.*
  ^*(**);
}
```

The above query could be rephrased as "In all types, look for any method with any number of parameters that is annotated
by an annotation from the `javax.persistence` package.

As with types, Classif supports specifying the required annotation attributes.

==== Matching by names

This is very much the same as with <<Matching by names,types>> except the fact that method names are simple identifiers and don't contain
any hierarchy. It therefore doesn't make sense to use the `**` glob to match them.

The method names can either be spelled out in full, matched by the `*` glob or matched using a regular expression:

```
type * {
  namedMethod();

  *(int);

  /__.*/(**);
}
```

This would match any type that would have a method called `namedMethod` that would have no parameters, in addition
the type would also have a method of any name with a single parameter of type `int` and finally the type would have
a method with any number of parameters and a name starting with `__`.

==== Matching by return type

You may have noticed that in all the examples above, the methods we were looking for lacked any information about their
return type. In accordance with the Classif principles, we didn't care about the return type and therefore we didn't
declare any.

If you wanted to match methods based on the return type though, you could certainly do so.

```
type * {
   !void /set.*/(*);
}
```

This could be rephrased as "find all setters that don't return void". We see a couple of things here. First we don't
specify the visibility, so it is not considered. Then we specify the return type (as we would in Java code) but we
negate it. Then we use a regular expression to match the name of the method. Finally we require that the method has
a single parameter of any type.

==== Matching by parameters

We've already seen examples of matching by method parameters in the sections above. That's because Classif can only
distinguish a field declaration from a method declaration by the presence of the parameters on the method (this is the
only violation of the "what's not specified is not considered" principle).

Therefore you always need to specify what kind of parameters a method should have. The parameters are matched using
a glob, so you can either spell out their type names, use `*` for matching any type or `**` to match any number of
parameters.

```
type * {
  methodWithNoParameters();

  methodWithOneParameter(*);

  methodWithZeroOrMoreParameters(**);

  methodWithIntAndPossiblySomeOtherParameters(int, **);
}
```

Of course, you can also match methods based on the presence of annotations on the method parameters.

```
type * {
  *(@javax.enterprise.event.Observes *);
}
```

This will find all the CDI event handlers. In any type, look for methods with any name that have a single parameter
of any type that is annotated by the `@Observes` annotation.

==== Matching by throws declarations

As you can declare what exceptions can be thrown from a java method, you can also match the methods using the thrown
exceptions with Classif.

```
type * {
  ^*(**) throws %e;
}

class %e=* extends java.lang.RuntimeException;
```

This will return all the methods in all types that are declared to throw any exception that inherits from
`RuntimeException`. Methods don't need to declare that and so this may be flagged in some way.

==== Matching by usage

Similarly to <<Matching by usage, types>>, methods can also be matched by what types they use. This can either
be a direct usage (e.g. the return type of a method, one of its parameters, ...) or indirect usage as well.
The semantics of what determines an indirect usage of a type is left to the structure provider that is supplied to
Classif.

```
type * {
  public ^*(**) uses sun.misc.Unsafe;
}
```

This will return all the methods that somehow reference the `sun.misc.Unsafe` class. Again the semantics of what is
a use of a type is left to the structure provider.

==== Matching by overriding

You can also match all methods that override some other method.

```
type * {
    ^*(**) overrides;
}
```

This will return all methods in all types that override some other method from any supertype.

```
type ^* {
  *(**) overrides from %t;
}

@com.acme.DoNotOverride
type %t=* {}
```

This will return all types that declare some methods that override methods declared in any type
annotated by the `@com.acme.DoNotOverride` annotation. Yes, this is a contrived example.. :)

==== Matching by default value

If you want want to for example find all annotation types that declare some attributes without a default
value, you could:

```
@interface ^* {
  *() !default;
}
```

NOTE: Because what is not specified is not considered, Classif somehow needs to express the lack of a default
differently than Java, which merely omits the declaration of the default value.

It is also possible to match by certain default value:

```
@interface * {
  ^*() default = {*, *, **}
}
```

This will return all the annotation attributes of any annotation type that have a default value which is
an array with 2 or more elements.

==== Matching by type parameters

This is very much the same as in the case of <<Matching by type parameters, types>>.

=== Matching Fields

Matching fields is very similar to matching methods, only simpler, because fields don't have that many moving parts.

```
type ^* {
  public !final *;
}
```

This will match any type that has a public mutable field of any name and any type.

=== Matching different types of elements in a single statement

It sometimes might be too verbose to wrap everything in a `type * {...}`. Classif therefore supports "generic" matches
that can match types, fields or methods using a single declaration. Because all these types don't share many common
characteristics, you can only match by visibility, the annotations present on them or on the fact whether they use some
type. Notice that you cannot even match them by name, because that type names are hierarchical, whereas method and field
names aren't.

```
@com.acme.Stable public|protected ^* uses %u;

@com.acme.Unstable type %u=*;
```

This will return any public or protected type, method or field annotated as `@Stable` that uses, in any sense determined
by the structure provider, a type that is annotated as `@Unstable`.
